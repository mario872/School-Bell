# School-Bell
A small Python Tkinter application built with PySimpleGUI to inform the user of how much time is left until the end of the school day, and the end of the school year.

### Update
I've now packaged this, but haven't found a way to stop Microsoft Smart Screen [Insert Angry Grumblings Here] to stop flagging main.exe as a virus. Hopefully I'll fix this soon.
